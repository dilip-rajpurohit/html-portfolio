    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm a beginner web developer with a strong passion for creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly
        websites. Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and exploring frameworks like React. I enjoy building
        small projects to sharpen my skills and love solving problems through code.</p>

    <p>I'm eager to grow as a developer, learn from real-world experiences, and contribute to meaningful web projects.
        Whether it's designing a simple landing page or experimenting with dynamic web apps, I'm always excited to turn
        ideas into working code.</p>
